```bash
 npm start
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the DApp.

3. Connect your Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom) to the DApp.


4. Browse ongoing reviews and place your own review.


## Smart Contracts

The smart contracts in this project facilitate the placement process. They handle review creation. These contracts are deployed on the Solana devnet blockchain.

- `lib.rs`: Responsible for creating new reviews.

## Testing

Smart contract tests are located in the `tests` folder inside the backend folder. These tests ensure the correct functioning of the smart contract. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.

2. Navigate from  root to backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

3. Run the following command to execute the tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

This command will initiate the smart contract tests and display the results in the terminal.


### Setting up the environment

First,enter to the frontend folder and install required libraries:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
